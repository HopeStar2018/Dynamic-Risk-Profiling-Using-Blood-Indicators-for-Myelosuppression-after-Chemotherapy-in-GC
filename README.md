# Dynamic-Risk-Profiling-Using-Blood-Indicators-for-Myelosuppression-after-Chemotherapy-in-GC

## ABSTRACT

As one of the most common adverse effects of chemotherapy, myelosuppression causes a large number of patients to experience malaise, fever, oral ulcers, and other unpleasant symptoms, which affect chemotherapy compliance, and in severe cases, secondary to infection, bleeding, and other serious adverse events, leading to increased hospitalization, delayed hospitalization, delayed chemotherapy period, and even induce multi-organ failure and endanger life. As a result, a more objective and precise way to predict the incidence and severity of myelosuppression in patients following each therapy is urgently needed in clinical practice.
